# 🌟 Efe Arabacı - AI & Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project is a creative and immersive showcase of my skills in AI and modern web development. It's designed to be more than just a resume; it's an interactive experience built with cutting-edge technologies like **React**, **Three.js**, and **GSAP**, inspired by the design philosophy of Awwwards.

The main goal is to present my projects and capabilities in a visually appealing and memorable way, reflecting my passion for building beautiful, functional, and high-performance digital solutions.
